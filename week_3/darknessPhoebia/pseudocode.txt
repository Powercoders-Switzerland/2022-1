> m + d: 2min
< d: 1min (or m)
> da + so: 5min
< m: 2min (or d)
> m + d: 2min
= Total: 12min

constraints
===========
2 people max per route
12 min in total (1 torch only)
specific speed of family members: slowest speed counts

solution
========
slowest couple should use the tunnel only 1 time
slowest need to go together: daughter and son 
fastest ones for the return routes

    INITIALIZE maxTime as 12
    INITIALIZE totalTime as 0
    INITIALIZE speedFather as 1
    INITIALIZE speedMother as 2
    INITIALIZE speedSon as 4
    INITIALIZE speedDaugther as 5
    INITIALIZE maxPeople as 2
    INITIALIZE peopleAtStart as 4
    INITIALIZE peopleOnTheOtherSide as 0

    INITIALIZE slowestCouple
    INITIALIZE fastestCouple

    Step1: Find out who the 2 fastest people are and store their slowest speed in fastestCouple
    Steps ...
#   Check on time constraint
#   Check on maxPeople in tunnel 
#   Check on peopleOnTheOtherSide
